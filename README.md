# Calc
A calculator console application that allows doing four basic mathematical operations with real numbers
Starting with version 1.2 the unit testing is included, featuring 18 tests for math functions and 4 functions for user input strings parsing

Each mathematical function may accept any amount of numbers that can be enter separately or in a string that should be separated by whitespace characters. In the latter case, if only one number is provided, then the result is NaN. Division by zero is also automatically detected.
